# laravel-hls-streaming

If you want to impress your senior quickly and also be prepared for real-world projects, here’s my advice:

Step 1 — Learn the easy manual FFmpeg + Video.js method first
You’ll understand the core concept of HLS streaming.
You’ll see how .m3u8 playlists and .ts chunks work.
No package magic — pure basics.
This will make you confident when someone says “make streaming like YouTube.”

Step 2 — Then learn Laravel-FFmpeg (ProtoneMedia)
Once you understand the basics, switch to this package.
It will save you time in real projects.
It supports automatic conversion and security features (AES-128, signed URLs).
This is what you’d likely use in a professional app.

📌 My short answer:
First: Manual FFmpeg + Video.js (foundation learning)
Then: Laravel-FFmpeg (for production use)

If you want, I can give you both versions side-by-side in one document so you learn the basics first and then see the Laravel-FFmpeg way right after. That will make you a streaming pro in 1–2 days.
